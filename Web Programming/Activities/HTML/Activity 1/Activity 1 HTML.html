    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <h2>HTML is a language for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web</h2>
    <h3>HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines the HTML language</h3>
    <h4>This version brings important changes to the role of HTML in the Web world, through new features such as
        semantics and accessibility</h4>
    <h5>It enables the use of new features that were previously only possible through other technologies</h5>
    <h6>Many HTML5 features have been designed to run on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets</h6>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Between 1991 and 1999, HTML evolved from version 1 to version 4. In 2008, the first public version of HTML5 was
        released.</p>
    <p>The early versions of HTML were defined with flexible syntax rules, which helped those unfamiliar with the Web.
        Over time, there was a trend toward making the syntax more strict. Despite this, for historical reasons
        (backward compatibility), browsers today are still able to interpret web pages developed with the earlier
        versions of HTML.</p>
